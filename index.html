    <h1>Introduction to Squash</h1>
      <h2>Background</h2>
        <p><strong>Squash</strong> was founded in the early 1800's in a small town in England.</p>
        <p>The sport is huge internationally and has slowly been gaining popularity in the United States. Squash is an amazing sport in that you can start getting into the game at any age. I've seen players start in their 30's pick up a squash racquet for the first time and turn out to be really strong players.</p> 
      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>It can seem really overwhelming jumping into a sport but if you go in with the a positive outlook, learning will be fun!
